# airbnb-clone-project
# Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

# Project Goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

Property Management: Develop property listing creation, updates, and retrieval features.

Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used to build a RESTful API.

Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.

PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.

GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.

Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

Redis: Used for caching and session management.

Docker: A Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Database Design
The database for this project includes several key entities that represent the core components of the system. Below is a breakdown of each entity and their relationships:

1. Users
id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user.

name: Full name of the user.

email: User's email address (must be unique).

password_hash: Hashed password for secure login.

role: Indicates whether the user is a host or guest.

2. Properties
id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each property.

user_id (Foreign Key): References the user who owns (hosts) the property.

title: Title or name of the property.

description: Detailed description of the property.

location: Address or location of the property.

3. Bookings
id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each booking.

user_id (Foreign Key): References the user who made the booking.

property_id (Foreign Key): References the property being booked.

start_date: Date when the booking starts.

end_date: Date when the booking ends.

4. Reviews
id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each review.

user_id (Foreign Key): References the user who wrote the review.

property_id (Foreign Key): References the property being reviewed.

rating: Numeric rating score.

comment: Textual feedback from the user.

5. Payments
id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each payment.

booking_id (Foreign Key): References the booking being paid for.

amount: Payment amount.

payment_method: Method used (e.g., credit card, PayPal).

payment_date: Date the payment was processed.

# Relationships
A User can have multiple Properties (if they are a host).

A User can make multiple Bookings and write multiple Reviews.

A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews.

A Booking is linked to one Property and one User.

A Payment is associated with one Booking.

# Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profile. It ensures secure authentication and maintains user roles such as host or guest to control access to different functionalities.

2. Property Management
Hosts can list new properties by adding details like title, description, location, and pricing. They can also edit or remove their listings, giving them full control over the availability of their spaces.

3. Booking System
Guests can browse available properties and make bookings for specific dates. This feature handles date validation, availability checks, and links each booking to the correct user and property.

4. Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have booked. This helps maintain quality and trust in the platform by providing feedback to hosts and other users.

5. Payment Integration
Secure payment processing is implemented to handle booking payments. Users can pay using supported methods, and each transaction is logged for record-keeping and dispute resolution.

# API Security
Securing backend APIs is critical to protect sensitive data, ensure user trust, and maintain the integrity of the system. The following key security measures will be implemented:

1. Authentication
Authentication ensures that only registered users can access the system by verifying their identity using secure login credentials or tokens (e.g., JWT). This prevents unauthorized access and protects user accounts from misuse.

2. Authorization
Authorization determines what actions a user can perform based on their role (e.g., host vs. guest). It ensures that users can only access or modify resources they own or are permitted to interact with (e.g., a host editing their properties).

3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given time. This helps prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) scenarios, maintaining the system‚Äôs performance and availability.

4. Input Validation & Sanitization
All API inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL or script injections. This is vital for defending against malicious payloads that could compromise the backend.

5. HTTPS Encryption
All communication with the API will be encrypted using HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This protects data such as login credentials and payment information while in transit.

# Why Security Matters
Protecting User Data: Personal information like email addresses and passwords must be securely stored and transmitted to maintain privacy and comply with data protection regulations.

Securing Payments: Payment transactions involve sensitive financial data and must be protected from theft and fraud through encryption and secure processing.

Maintaining Trust: A secure API fosters user trust and ensures platform reliability. A breach could damage reputation and lead to legal or financial consequences.


# CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. This ensures that new features and bug fixes can be reliably and quickly delivered to users without manual intervention. Every time code is pushed to the repository, the CI/CD pipeline can run automated tests, build the application, and deploy it to a staging or production environment.

# üîß Why CI/CD is Important
Improves Code Quality: Automated testing helps catch bugs early before they reach production.

Increases Deployment Speed: Reduces manual effort and allows teams to deploy changes faster and more frequently.

Ensures Consistency: Builds and deployments are repeatable and consistent across environments.

Encourages Collaboration: Makes it easier for teams to work together by integrating changes frequently and resolving issues early.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates workflows for testing and deploying on each push or pull request.

Docker: Packages the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment.

Heroku / AWS / Netlify (Optional): Can be used for deploying the application once it's ready for production.
